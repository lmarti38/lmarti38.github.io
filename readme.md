Hello. My Twine story is a simple look through of Queen Elizabeth I. The story has a few branching points but other than that it simply goes through the start of her life and discusses important individuals like Robert Dudley and William Cecil. It discusses her involvment in several pivotal moments throughout Tudor history such as the Act of Supremacy and the Treaty of Edinburgh.

The first commit involved the initializing of the repostiory on github.
The second involved the story itself. 
The third involved Mini-Assignments 3 & 4 which invovled the usage of multimedia such as pictures and video as well as conditionals.
The fourth commit was Mini-Assignments 5 & 6 involving the inclusion of variables and input.
The fifth commit involves the stylizing of text with color and the inclusion of this readme file.
The colors chosen were purple and yellow primarily for a more royal feel. The final three passages though are red to signify the end of the story.
The final commit is the inclusion of this readme file.

Thank you for reading my Twine story!
